## Contribution

You are welcome to improve the document. Submit your changes via a pull request or create an issue describing what improvement you'd like to see. Changes to the Guide contents are accepted only in the English version, localizations only reflect the English guide in specific release versions.

## Translation

If you want to translate the Guide, submit a pull request of translated `guide.md` and place it into a directory corresponding to the language code. For example `zh/guide.md` for Chinese translation. Make sure the language codes are the same as in the [jstris-multilang](https://github.com/jezevec10/jstris-multilang) project.

### Updating an existing translation

If you want to update an existing translation to sync up with the updates in the English version, this is the suggested way:

1) Check the metadata file [contributors.php](https://github.com/jezevec10/jstris-guide/blob/master/contributors.php) and find out the current version of the translated guide.
2) Check the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/jezevec10/jstris-guide/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to see what has changed to the Guide since that version. You can display the difference in the file by clicking on version names in the change log.
3) Update the translation to the newest version release (ignore the *Unreleased* section in the changelog) and submit a pull request.
