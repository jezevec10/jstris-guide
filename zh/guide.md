## 总览·Overview

Jstris uses the same basic mechanics as most other block games. It follows guideline rules. One notable feature is its extensive use of replays. In every single game mode you play in and complete, a replay will be generated for you. Watching and analyzing yourself is an integral part to self-improvement, and Jstris’s replays makes doing that all too easy.

Unlike other sites, you can be sure Jstris’s Leaderboards are completely clean and hack-free. Moderators work around the clock to remove suspicious records to ensure you a trusworthy list of global achievements. 

It is recommended to create an account on Jstris. To do so, click on *Register* at the top right corner. Only an email, username, and password is required. With an account, you can see a multitude of statistics including your Best Times in singleplayer modes, multiplayer stats, improvement stats, replays, and much more. You can now also see yourself on the Leaderboard (unregistered users’ scores are excluded). 

和其他方块一样，Jstris使用世界基准（Guideline）规则。值得一提的是Jstris的录像回放（Replay）系统。每次游戏后都会自动生成游戏录像。回放、分析并自我提升，在Jstris的Replay里都非常简单。

不同于其他网站，Jstris的排行榜真实可靠，拒绝被黑。排行榜由管理员（Moderators）时常查看并移除可疑的记录，来确保真实可信全球成就表。（发现可疑记录也可以联系管理员检查哦~）

虽然点开即玩，无需注册，但仍然推荐在jstris上创建账号。点一下右上的注册，顺次写下 用户名、邮箱、两遍密码就可以了，很快的~ 在拥有账号后，你可以查看大量的数据，包括你的单人模式下的最佳时间、多人数据、进步数据、回放、等等。你还能在排行榜上看到你自己（未注册用户的分数也包含在内）。

## 多人游戏·Multiplayer

### 机器人房·Bot Room

Upon entering the site, all players are immediately thrown into the **Bot Room**, a default room that is so named because of the one Bot that is always present. It is always located in the top left corner of all your opponents, easily distinguishable by its uniform red color.

在进入网站后，所有玩家都会立即放入 **Bot Room**，即默认房间。这样称呼是因为1个Bot（机器人）永远在线。位置也永远在你所有对手的左上角，还有着红色方块，在人群当中特别显眼易区分~

![MisaMino bot in opponents view][image4]

There are 4 different bots in Jstris. Here they are listed by strength, and the commands to change to that specific one, entered into the textbox.

下面是在Jstris里按强度顺序列出的4个不同的Bot。在聊天框内输入对应指令更改Bot类型。

- MisaMino: `/changeBot misamino`
- Real_Block: `/changeBot real`
- ~~jez_Block: `/changeBot jez`~~ (removed on 2018.09.21)
- ~~Fool bot: `/changeBot fool`~~ (removed on 2018.09.21)

*\*Note that all commands must be entered in between games. Any command entered during a game will be nullified.*

*\*注意：只能在两场游戏间输入指令，在游戏进行中输入指令会被忽略。*

Misamino is by far the strongest bot, perhaps the strongest block placing bot ever created yet. When paired with the maximum 5 PPS (pieces per second), it becomes a formidable opponent that can easily dismantle the strongest human players in a 1v1. However, bot performance suffers when there are >5 humans in the Bot Room, and it is likely to top out immediately. This brings us to our next command:  /botPPS.

The speed of the bot can be changed. To do this, type in `/bot ?` only replace the ? with any number between .3 and 5. For example, if I wanted the bot to play at 2 PPS, I would type in `/bot 2`. If I wanted the bot to play at 1.73 PPS, I would type in `/bot 1.73`.

Misamino是目前已知的最强bot之一 ~~~zzz尚未嵌入到js当中，等一个奏大爷适配~~~ ，当bot使用5PPS（块/秒）的速度时，可以在单挑房内，轻松暴打最强人类选手。然而bot在多人房间时表现并不佳，经常很快就会死掉。

所以你可以使用/bot [PPS] 的命令来控制bot的摆块速度。[PPS]的取值区间为 0.3~5。
如/bot 2 即将bot的摆块速度改为2块/秒，/bot 1.73 改为1.73块/秒等。

 


Playing in the Bot Room can be tough! What’s unique about Jstris is that it throws humble beginners and world-class opponents together into the mix, along with everyone else between. If you get tired from playing and simply want to watch, then use the command `/spectate` or `/spec`. To play again, use the command `/play`. 

在默认房Bot Room里面可能会吃瘪！Jstris的一大特点就是可以让新手和世界大触混合在一起，互相进行大混战。如果你玩累了只想观战，可以使用指令`/spectate` 或 `/spec` 进行旁观。想再次加入游戏时，使用指令`/play`。

### 单挑房·1v1 Room

The Bot Room isn’t the only room there is. To view the full room list, click on *Lobby* in the bottom left of your playfield. The 2nd most popular room on Jstris is usually the **1v1 Room**. This room has a maximum of 2 playing users, although anyone is free to come and watch even if it’s full. Use this room to settle differences with your friends or to battle it out with a worthy player. If you’re keeping score, and you want to reset it, type in `/resetCounter` and all scores will be reset to 0.

当然房间不止有Bot Room一个，点击游戏区域底部左侧的 *大厅·Lobby* 按钮查看完整房间列表。Jstris中第二受欢迎的通常就是**单挑房·1v1 Room**了。这个房间最大只能 2 人同时游玩，不过其他人可以进房旁观。用1v1 Room来和你的朋友，或者旗鼓相当的对手一决高下吧！
如果你在记录分数，想重新计分的话，使用指令`/resetCounter`就可以分数清零。

### 挖掘房·Cheese Room

Garbage, also known as cheese, is the primary way to knock out opponents in multiplayer modes. It is an important skill to downstack through cheese. Practice just how fast you can downstack in the **Cheese Room**, a room that starts games with 10 lines of garbage. First to reach the bottom wins. 10 lines too easy for you? Adjust the amount of starting lines with the command `/set height ?` , with the question mark representing a number from 1 to 20. 

发送垃圾行，是多人游戏中KO对手的主要方式。而挖掘垃圾行就成为了一个重要的能力。定行挖掘模式，也称作~~~瑞士~~~奶酪模式~~~（出自C2）~~~，是练习挖掘能力的好去处。最快速度完成10行挖掘以获胜。10行太简单了？使用`/set height [lines]`来更换起始行数（1~20）。

### 限速房·Speed Limit Room

Want to play with a friend but the skill level between yourselves is too great? Or you’re just getting started and tired of losing instantly in the pro-dominated Bot Room? There’s a Speed Limit Room in place for just that occasion. The default Speed Limit Room is set at 1.5 PPS, which means a player cannot go over 1.5 PPS. Any attempts to go faster will result in the player’s screen being temporarily locked. All Speed Limit Rooms are indicated by the little speedometer icon - [SPEEDOMETER_ICON]. Custom rooms can have any speed limit from 0 PPS to 20 PPS. 

不能和你的神仙朋友一起愉快对战？被大触横行的默认房Bot Room虐惨了？这就轮到了限速房的出场了！限速房默认设置速度为 1.5块/秒，超速的话会使得屏幕暂时锁定。
任何限速房都有一个限速标志[SPEEDOMETER_ICON]。自定义房间可以设定0.1~20块/秒PPS（0为不限速）。

![the lobby, where you can join and create rooms][image5]

### 组队房·Team Room

The final default room is the **Team Room**. Pick a side, red or blue, and battle and bring glory for your team.
最后的默认房是 **组队房·Team Room**，选择蓝方或红方，然后为你的队伍赢得荣誉吧！~~~打群架~~~

![team game in progress][image11]

## 单人游戏·Singleplayer

### 竞速模式·Sprint

The foundation, and with the most simple objective, **Sprint** is the most popular singleplayer mode on Jstris. Clear X amount of lines as fast as you can. Jstris offers 20, 40, 100, and 1000 line Sprint modes. 

基础而又最简单的**竞速模式·Sprint**是Jstris最受欢迎的单人模式，以最快的速度消除指定行数。Jstris支持20、40（默认）、100和1000行模式。

### 挖掘竞速·Cheese Race

Less brash and more analytical than Sprint, **Cheese Race** requires more thinking as you downstack through garbage lines in the most efficient way. Jstris offers 10, 18, 100, and infinity line Cheese Race modes.

比单纯的竞速更需要思考和计算，**挖掘竞速·Cheese Race**要求你在挖掘过程中寻找最有效的方式。Jstris支持10、18、100和无限行挖掘模式。

### 限时极限·Ultra

Score-focused and rewarding advanced techniques such as t-spins and back-to-backs, **Ultra** is a great way to improve your attacking prowess for use in multiplayer. 

**限时极限·Ultra**注重使用高级技巧如T-spin和Back to back等及其奖励分数，是提升你在多人游戏中高超技巧的使用的好方法。

### 生存模式·Survival

Quite possibly the most challenging of the singleplayer modes, **Survival** is much like Cheese Race only the garbage rises at a constant rate of one line per second. Survive against the rising lines for as long as you can. 

可能是单人游戏中最具有挑战性的模式，**生存模式·Survival**类似于以1行/秒的固定速度涨垃圾行的挖掘模式。面对不断涨起的行尽可能生存更久吧！

### 地图·Maps

Recently, the **Maps** mode was introduced to Jstris. Maps brings an element of creativity while also preparing players to downstack effectively in difficult and unusual positions. Create your own map in the *Map Designer*. Once published, anyone in the world can play it and compete for the fastest time. There is a limit of 5 published maps per day and 10 unpublished maps in queue. Maps also has a leaderboard. On every map, three medals are given, Gold for 1st place, Silver for 2nd place, and Bronze for 3rd place. Score in the top three of any map to win some medals and secure your place on the leaderboard! 

近日。Jstris引入了**地图·Maps**模式。地图模式带入了创造元素，同时也让玩家准备好在困难与不寻常的位置进行高效挖掘。在*地图设计器·Map Designer*创建你自己的地图。一旦公开发表 (publish)，世界上的任何人都可以玩并且竞争最快时间。每日限定发表5个、待发表队列限定10个。每个地图都有排行榜，并且还有金、银、铜三个奖章分别对应第一、第二、第三名。在任何地图中获取前三名来赢得奖章并保住你在排行榜的位置吧！

*\*Note that the Maps leaderboards updates once every hour at the 30 minute mark, so new changes are not immediate.*

*\*注意：地图排行榜每小时的xx:30更新一次，所以新更改可能不会立即生效。*

## 系统设置·Configuration

To see the configuration of any room on Jstris, use the command `/config`. Now we will go over each of the settings. 

使用指令`/config`在Jstris的任何房间查看设置。现在让我们了解每个选项。

### 攻击连击表·Attack and Combo table

The default attack and combo table in Jstris (which can be customized in private rooms) is as follows:

### 垃圾行分配方式·Garbage Distribution

There are 4 different systems in how garbage is sent around during multiplayer matches. They are as follows:

在多人游戏中，有4种垃圾行分配的方式如下：

- 目标指定·Targets `/set garbage targets`
- 平均分配·Divide `/set garbage divide`
- 全部送出·To all `/set garbage toAll`
- 送给最少·To least `/set garbage toLeast`

**Targets** is always the default (except in the Team Room) and by far the most popular. In Targets, a target is rotated around every opponent in the room, in equal and fixed increments, and whoever the target was landed on at the moment you send garbage is the one who gets that garbage you sent. 

**目标指定·Targets**为默认设置，也应用最广。同TOP、TF的多人模式的准星一样，目标框在房间内每个人循环指向，

In the **Divide** garbage distribution system (GDS), any garbage you send is equally divided among all players. For example, in a room with 2 other opponents, if you send a T-spin Double (4 lines), each of your opponents will get 2 lines. 

In the **To all** GDS, any garbage you send is sent to every player in the room. For example, in a room with 4 opponents, if you send a Perfect Clear (10 lines), all 4 opponents will recieve 10 lines each, or a total of 40 lines. As you can surmise from the example, rooms with To all garbage tend to be hectic, with fast rising garbage and characteristically short games. 

In the **To least** GDS, garbage you send is sent to the player who in that game had the least garbage sent so far. For example, in a room with 3 other opponenets, you send 4 lines. Opponent A recieved 50 lines in the game already at the moment you sent the attack. Opponent B recieved 53. Opponent C recieved 58. Because Opponent A recieved the least lines so far, the 4 lines from your line clear will be sent to him.

### Garbage Blocking

There are 4 types of garbage blocking systems on Jstris. They are as follows:

- Full
- Limited
- None
- Instant

**Full** is the default blocking system on Jstris. Other clients that use Full are *TF* (e+ rooms) and *TOP*. Under the Full garbage blocking system, incoming garbage appears as a red bar to your right. It doesn’t rise up on your playfield, however, until you place a piece down. The incoming garbage can be reduced with sent lines (such as a 4 lines) and, if you have already started a combo, will pause completely until you finish the combo.

**Limited** blocking system is very similar to Full but with one difference. Incoming garbage is inserted as soon as you drop a piece, regardless of whether a combo was started already or not. In other words, incoming garbage does not pause during combos the way Full does. Like in Full, incoming garbage can be reduced with sent lines. Clients that use Limited include *PPT* and *TB* and *TF* (non e+ rooms).

In the **None** blocking system, garbage can never be reduced or cancelled. Incoming garbage will first appear as a red bar (like in Full and Limited) and then be inserted into your playfield as soon as you drop a piece. If an opponent sends you 10 lines, even if you clear 4 lines as your next piece, the garbage will not reduce to 6. Instead, you will still recieve 10 lines while sending 4 to your opponent. 

In the **Instant** blocking system, there is no red bar at all. The moment an opponent sends an attack, its garbage will rise up on your field. There is no blocking it. 

|         | Red bar (queue) | Blocking? |
| ------- | :-------------: | :-------: |
| Full    |       Yes       |    Yes    |
| Limited |       Yes       |    Yes    |
| None    |       Yes       |    No     |
| Instant |       No        |    No     |

### Randomizer

Randomizers are basically the formula for what and what order blocks you get. Jstris has 4 different randomizers. They are as follows:

- 7-bag
- 14-bag
- Classic
- One Block

**7-bag** is the standard and default randomizer. Imagine a small bag with 1 each of the 7 different blocks. Now you draw out, one by one, a piece until the bag is empty. Then you get a new bag with again 1 each of the 7 different blocks. Now you draw out one by one once more. Repeat. This is how the 7-bag randomizer works. 

**14-bag** is much like 7-bag only the bag is doubled in size, with 2 of each of the 7 blocks. Once again, you draw out each piece from the bag, one by one, until the bag is empty. Rinse and repeat. 

**Classic** randomizer gives you completely random pieces. This randomizer makes stacking very challenging.

**One Block** is perhaps the oddest randomizer of them all. A randomly selected block is chosen for you at the start and you will get only that specific block for the whole game. 

### Previews

Jstris has a default of 5 previews. In custom rooms, you can set anywhere from 0 to 5 previews. 

### Solid Garbage

Solid garbage are unclearable lines that rise up from the bottom to “hurry up” the game so it doesn’t extend indefinitely. They are slightly darker than normal garbage lines. In the Bot Room, solid garbage by default starts to come after 2 minutes. Solid garbage is also customizable in custom rooms.

![Solid Garbage][image7]

### Clear Delay

Clear delay is a fixed amount of time that passes after you clear any line(s). During this time, you can’t do anything. Many classic block games and PPT use clear delay, but Jstris by default has 0 delay, and for the most part it is never used here. However, it is customizable if you want to turn it on. Its range is 0 milliseconds to 6000 milliseconds.

### Garbage Delay

Garbage delay is a fixed amount of time between the incoming garbage indicated by the red bar and the insertion of that garbage into the playfield. By default, it is set at 500 milliseconds. It is customizable from a range of 0 milliseconds to 1000 milliseconds. A higher garbage delay allows for more pieces to be played before garbage is inserted, while a lower garbage delay allows for less pieces to be played before garbage insertion. Or in other words, the higher the garbage delay, the more opportunity it gives to block more effectively. Another way to define garbage delay is “the minimumum amount of time an incoming attack has to be visible in the red bar before a placed block can trigger the insertion of that garbage to the playfield.”

### Messiness

Garbage messiness refers to the difficulty level to clear certain types of garbage. To change the messiness of garbage in a room, use the command `/set messiness ?`, where the ? is replaced with any number from -100 to 100. -100 is the least messy garbage configuration, and the garbage hole will only appear in one column throughout the entirety of the game (left picture). 100 is the most messy garbage configuration and the garbage hole will appear in any of the 10 columns, making it much more difficult to downstack (right picture).

## FAQ

### Q: What do those abbreviations in the Game Results table mean?

A: B2B = back-to-back. B2Bpm = back-to-back per minute. APM = attack per minute. SPM = sent per minute. PPS = pieces per second. Rep = replay.

![game results table][image9]

### Q: What is DAS?

A: DAS is a form of horizontal piece sensitivity. DAS stands for delayed auto shift. It controls for how long you have to hold down the left or right keys before the block moves to the direction you want. With a very low DAS, even the lightest touch on a key will immediately send the block moving. With a very high DAS, you will have to hold down the key for longer before the block starts moving. Professionals on average tend to use a lower DAS because the increased sensitivity allows them to play faster. The default DAS on Jstris is 133. If it still feels too sensitive, raise that number until you feel comfortable. If it feels too slow, lower the number. Adjust and find what suits you.

### Q: What is ARR?

A: ARR is another form of horizontal piece sensitivity. ARR stands for auto repeat rate. It controls for how fast the block moves left or right. This is a little easier to understand than DAS. Quite simply, with a very low ARR, blocks will zoom almost immediately to the direction you want when holding down the left or right keys. With a very high ARR, blocks will move very slowly in the direction you want when holding down the left or right keys. The default ARR on Jstris is 0, meaning it is very fast, almost instantaneous (remember Jstris is one of the fastest clients on average). If it feels too fast for you, raise the number until you feel comfortable.

### Q: What is finesse?

A: Finesse is defined as the most efficient way to move a block. Good finesse is important for playing smoother and faster. The number next to finesse denotes how many finesse errors were committed. So a 0 finesse score means you made no finesse errors.  Ideally, the closer you get to 0, the better. Finesse is something that needs to be learned in order to know how to do. There are many resources online explaining it. This video is a good starting point: [Tutorial: How to Play Fast!](https://youtu.be/_QBs703nOnk?t=502).

### Q: Can I create a private room?

A: Yes. Click *Lobby*, then *Create Room*, then check the box that says *Private*. Copy and give the room link to anyone you want to join your private room. Here’s a tip: grab the link of any room, public or private, by using the command `/link`.

### Q: Can I play Jstris offline?

A: Yes. In order to play offline, you have to first download Jstris while you are online. To do this, right click on the home page, press "Save as", and download the html file. Note that only single player modes can be played offline, and the scores will not be saved.
