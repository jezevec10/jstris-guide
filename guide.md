## Overview

Jstris uses the same basic mechanics as most other block games. It follows guideline rules. One notable feature is its extensive use of replays. In every single game mode you play in and complete, a replay will be generated for you. Watching and analyzing yourself is an integral part to self-improvement, and Jstris’s replays makes doing that all too easy.

Unlike other sites, you can be sure Jstris’s Leaderboards are completely clean and hack-free. Moderators work around the clock to remove suspicious records to ensure you a trusworthy list of global achievements. 

It is recommended to create an account on Jstris. To do so, click on *Register* at the top right corner. Only an email, username, and password is required. With an account, you can see a multitude of statistics including your Best Times in singleplayer modes, multiplayer stats, improvement stats, replays, and much more. You can now also see yourself on the Leaderboard (unregistered users’ scores are excluded).

## Multiplayer

### Bot Room

Upon entering the site, all players are immediately thrown into the **Bot Room**, a default room that is so named because of the one Bot that is always present. It is always located in the top left corner of all your opponents, easily distinguishable by its uniform red color.

![MisaMino bot in opponents view][image4]

There are 4 different bots in Jstris. Here they are listed by strength, and the commands to change to that specific one, entered into the textbox.

- MisaMino: `/changeBot misamino`
- Real_Block: `/changeBot real`
- ~~jez_Block: `/changeBot jez`~~ (removed on 2018.09.21)
- ~~Fool bot: `/changeBot fool`~~ (removed on 2018.09.21)

*\*Note that all commands must be entered in between games. Any command entered during a game will be nullified.*

Misamino is by far the strongest bot, perhaps the strongest block placing bot ever created yet. When paired with the maximum 5 PPS (pieces per second), it becomes a formidable opponent that can easily dismantle the strongest human players in a 1v1. However, bot performance suffers when there are >5 humans in the Bot Room, and it is likely to top out immediately. This brings us to our next command:  /botPPS.

The speed of the bot can be changed. To do this, type in `/bot ?` only replace the ? with any number between .3 and 5. For example, if I wanted the bot to play at 2 PPS, I would type in `/bot 2`. If I wanted the bot to play at 1.73 PPS, I would type in `/bot 1.73`. 

Playing in the Bot Room can be tough! What’s unique about Jstris is that it throws humble beginners and world-class opponents together into the mix, along with everyone else between. If you get tired from playing and simply want to watch, then use the command `/spectate` or `/spec`. To play again, use the command `/play`. 

### 1v1 Room

The Bot Room isn’t the only room there is. To view the full room list, click on *Lobby* in the bottom left of your playfield. The 2nd most popular room on Jstris is usually the **1v1 Room**. This room has a maximum of 2 playing users, although anyone is free to come and watch even if it’s full. Use this room to settle differences with your friends or to battle it out with a worthy player. If you’re keeping score, and you want to reset it, type in `/resetCounter` and all scores will be reset to 0.

### Cheese Room

Garbage, also known as cheese, is the primary way to knock out opponents in multiplayer modes. It is an important skill to downstack through cheese. Practice just how fast you can downstack in the **Cheese Room**, a room that starts games with 10 lines of garbage. First to reach the bottom wins. 10 lines too easy for you? Adjust the amount of starting lines with the command `/set height ?` , with the question mark representing a number from 1 to 20. 

### Speed Limit Room

Want to play with a friend but the skill level between yourselves is too great? Or you’re just getting started and tired of losing instantly in the pro-dominated Bot Room? There’s a Speed Limit Room in place for just that occasion. The default Speed Limit Room is set at 1.5 PPS, which means a player cannot go over 1.5 PPS. Any attempts to go faster will result in the player’s screen being temporarily locked. All Speed Limit Rooms are indicated by the little speedometer icon - [SPEEDOMETER_ICON]. Custom rooms can have any speed limit from 0 PPS to 20 PPS. 

![the lobby, where you can join and create rooms][image5]

### Team Room

The final default room is the **Team Room**. Pick a side, red or blue, and battle and bring glory for your team.

## Singleplayer

### Sprint

The foundation, and with the most simple objective, **Sprint** is the most popular singleplayer mode on Jstris. Clear X amount of lines as fast as you can. Jstris offers 20, 40, 100, and 1000 line Sprint modes. 

### Cheese Race

Less brash and more analytical than Sprint, **Cheese Race** requires more thinking as you downstack through garbage lines in the most efficient way. Jstris offers 10, 18, 100, and infinity line Cheese Race modes.

### Ultra

Score-focused and rewarding advanced techniques such as t-spins and back-to-backs, **Ultra** is a great way to improve your attacking prowess for use in multiplayer. 

### Survival

Quite possibly the most challenging of the singleplayer modes, **Survival** is much like Cheese Race only the garbage rises at a constant rate of one line per second. Survive against the rising lines for as long as you can. 

### Maps

Recently, the **Maps** mode was introduced to Jstris. Maps brings an element of creativity while also preparing players to downstack effectively in difficult and unusual positions. Create your own map in the *Map Designer*. Once published, anyone in the world can play it and compete for the fastest time. There is a limit of 5 published maps per day and 10 unpublished maps in queue. Maps also has a leaderboard. On every map, three medals are given, Gold for 1st place, Silver for 2nd place, and Bronze for 3rd place. Score in the top three of any map to win some medals and secure your place on the leaderboard! 

*\*Note that the Maps leaderboards updates once every hour at the 30 minute mark, so new changes are not immediate.*

## Configuration

To see the configuration of any room on Jstris, use the command `/config`. Now we will go over each of the settings. 

### Attack and Combo table

The default attack and combo table in Jstris (which can be customized in private rooms) is as follows:

| Attack Type        | Lines Sent |   | Combo # | Lines Sent |
| :----------------- | ---------: | - | ------: | ---------: |
| 0 lines            |      **0** |   |       0 |      **0** |
| 1 lines (single)   |      **0** |   |       1 |      **0** |
| 2 lines (double)   |      **1** |   |       2 |      **1** |
| 3 lines (triple)   |      **2** |   |       3 |      **1** |
| 4 lines            |      **4** |   |       4 |      **1** |
| T-spin Double      |      **4** |   |       5 |      **2** |
| T-spin Triple      |      **6** |   |       6 |      **2** |
| T-spin Single      |      **2** |   |       7 |      **3** |
| T-spin Mini Single |      **0** |   |       8 |      **3** |
| Perfect Clear      |     **10** |   |       9 |      **4** |
| Back-to-Back       |     **+1** |   |      10 |      **4** |
|                    |            |   |      11 |      **4** |
|                    |            |   |     12+ |      **5** |

### Garbage Distribution

There are 4 different systems in how garbage is sent around during multiplayer matches. They are as follows:

- Targets `/set garbage targets`
- Divide `/set garbage divide`
- To all `/set garbage toAll`
- To least `/set garbage toLeast`

**Targets** is always the default (except in the Team Room) and by far the most popular. In Targets, a target is rotated around every opponent in the room, in equal and fixed increments, and whoever the target was landed on at the moment you send garbage is the one who gets that garbage you sent. 

In the **Divide** garbage distribution system (GDS), any garbage you send is equally divided among all players. For example, in a room with 2 other opponents, if you send a T-spin Double (4 lines), each of your opponents will get 2 lines. 

In the **To all** GDS, any garbage you send is sent to every player in the room. For example, in a room with 4 opponents, if you send a Perfect Clear (10 lines), all 4 opponents will recieve 10 lines each, or a total of 40 lines. As you can surmise from the example, rooms with To all garbage tend to be hectic, with fast rising garbage and characteristically short games. 

In the **To least** GDS, garbage you send is sent to the player who in that game had the least garbage sent so far. For example, in a room with 3 other opponenets, you send 4 lines. Opponent A recieved 50 lines in the game already at the moment you sent the attack. Opponent B recieved 53. Opponent C recieved 58. Because Opponent A recieved the least lines so far, the 4 lines from your line clear will be sent to him.

### Garbage Blocking

There are 4 types of garbage blocking systems on Jstris. They are as follows:

- Full
- Limited
- None
- Instant

**Full** is the default blocking system on Jstris. Other clients that use Full are *TF* (e+ rooms) and *TOP*. Under the Full garbage blocking system, incoming garbage appears as a red bar to your right. It doesn’t rise up on your playfield, however, until you place a piece down. The incoming garbage can be reduced with sent lines (such as a 4 lines) and, if you have already started a combo, will pause completely until you finish the combo.

**Limited** blocking system is very similar to Full but with one difference. Incoming garbage is inserted as soon as you drop a piece, regardless of whether a combo was started already or not. In other words, incoming garbage does not pause during combos the way Full does. Like in Full, incoming garbage can be reduced with sent lines. Clients that use Limited include *PPT* and *TB* and *TF* (non e+ rooms).

In the **None** blocking system, garbage can never be reduced or cancelled. Incoming garbage will first appear as a red bar (like in Full and Limited) and then be inserted into your playfield as soon as you drop a piece. If an opponent sends you 10 lines, even if you clear 4 lines as your next piece, the garbage will not reduce to 6. Instead, you will still recieve 10 lines while sending 4 to your opponent. 

In the **Instant** blocking system, there is no red bar at all. The moment an opponent sends an attack, its garbage will rise up on your field. There is no blocking it. 

|         | Red bar (queue) | Blocking? |
| ------- | :-------------: | :-------: |
| Full    |       Yes       |    Yes    |
| Limited |       Yes       |    Yes    |
| None    |       Yes       |    No     |
| Instant |       No        |    No     |

### Randomizer

Randomizers are basically the formula for what and what order blocks you get. Jstris has 4 different randomizers. They are as follows:

- 7-bag
- 14-bag
- Classic
- One Block

**7-bag** is the standard and default randomizer. Imagine a small bag with 1 each of the 7 different blocks. Now you draw out, one by one, a piece until the bag is empty. Then you get a new bag with again 1 each of the 7 different blocks. Now you draw out one by one once more. Repeat. This is how the 7-bag randomizer works. 

**14-bag** is much like 7-bag only the bag is doubled in size, with 2 of each of the 7 blocks. Once again, you draw out each piece from the bag, one by one, until the bag is empty. Rinse and repeat. 

**Classic** randomizer gives you completely random pieces. This randomizer makes stacking very challenging.

**One Block** is perhaps the oddest randomizer of them all. A randomly selected block is chosen for you at the start and you will get only that specific block for the whole game. 

### Previews

Jstris has a default of 5 previews. In custom rooms, you can set anywhere from 0 to 5 previews. 

### Solid Garbage

Solid garbage are unclearable lines that rise up from the bottom to “hurry up” the game so it doesn’t extend indefinitely. They are slightly darker than normal garbage lines. In the Bot Room, solid garbage by default starts to come after 2 minutes. Solid garbage is also customizable in custom rooms.

![Solid Garbage][image7]

### Clear Delay

Clear delay is a fixed amount of time that passes after you clear any line(s). During this time, you can’t do anything. Many classic block games and PPT use clear delay, but Jstris by default has 0 delay, and for the most part it is never used here. However, it is customizable if you want to turn it on. Its range is 0 milliseconds to 6000 milliseconds.

### Garbage Delay

Garbage delay is a fixed amount of time between the incoming garbage indicated by the red bar and the insertion of that garbage into the playfield. By default, it is set at 500 milliseconds. It is customizable from a range of 0 milliseconds to 1000 milliseconds. A higher garbage delay allows for more pieces to be played before garbage is inserted, while a lower garbage delay allows for less pieces to be played before garbage insertion. Or in other words, the higher the garbage delay, the more opportunity it gives to block more effectively. Another way to define garbage delay is “the minimumum amount of time an incoming attack has to be visible in the red bar before a placed block can trigger the insertion of that garbage to the playfield.”

### Messiness

Garbage messiness refers to the difficulty level to clear certain types of garbage. To change the messiness of garbage in a room, use the command `/set messiness ?`, where the ? is replaced with any number from -100 to 100. -100 is the least messy garbage configuration, and the garbage hole will only appear in one column throughout the entirety of the game (left picture). 100 is the most messy garbage configuration and the garbage hole will appear in any of the 10 columns, making it much more difficult to downstack (right picture).

## FAQ

### Q: Can I add a bot to my private or custom room?

A: No. Currently, we only have one bot on Jstris, which permanently resides in the Bot Room. However, private bots may be a reality in the future.

### Q: What do those abbreviations in the Game Results table mean?

A: B2B = back-to-back. B2Bpm = back-to-back per minute. APM = attack per minute. SPM = sent per minute. PPS = pieces per second. Rep = replay.

![game results table][image9]

### Q: What is DAS?

A: DAS is a form of horizontal piece sensitivity. DAS stands for delayed auto shift. It controls for how long you have to hold down the left or right keys before the block moves to the direction you want. With a very low DAS, even the lightest touch on a key will immediately send the block moving. With a very high DAS, you will have to hold down the key for longer before the block starts moving. Professionals on average tend to use a lower DAS because the increased sensitivity allows them to play faster. The default DAS on Jstris is 133. If it still feels too sensitive, raise that number until you feel comfortable. If it feels too slow, lower the number. Adjust and find what suits you.

### Q: What is ARR?

A: ARR is another form of horizontal piece sensitivity. ARR stands for auto repeat rate. It controls for how fast the block moves left or right. This is a little easier to understand than DAS. Quite simply, with a very low ARR, blocks will zoom almost immediately to the direction you want when holding down the left or right keys. With a very high ARR, blocks will move very slowly in the direction you want when holding down the left or right keys. The default ARR on Jstris is 0, meaning it is very fast, almost instantaneous (remember Jstris is one of the fastest clients on average). If it feels too fast for you, raise the number until you feel comfortable.

### Q: What is finesse?

A: Finesse is defined as the most efficient way to move a block. Good finesse is important for playing smoother and faster. The number next to finesse denotes how many finesse errors were committed. So a 0 finesse score means you made no finesse errors.  Ideally, the closer you get to 0, the better. Finesse is something that needs to be learned in order to know how to do. There are many resources online explaining it. This video is a good starting point: [Tutorial: How to Play Fast!](https://youtu.be/_QBs703nOnk?t=502).

### Q: Can I create a private room?

A: Yes. Click *Lobby*, then *Create Room*, then check the box that says *Private*. Copy and give the room link to anyone you want to join your private room. Here’s a tip: grab the link of any room, public or private, by using the command `/link`.

### Q: Can I play Jstris offline?

A: Yes. In order to play offline, you have to first download Jstris while you are online. To do this, right click on the home page, press "Save as", and download the html file. Note that only single player modes can be played offline, and the scores will not be saved.

## Additional Information

Jstris runs entirely on donations. There are no advertisements whatsoever. Due to the considerable amount of stored replays and game data, a powerful server is required to run Jstris. All donations are much appreciated and will help keep Jstris running - see the [About](/about) section on the website to learn more.
